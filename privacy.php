        <div class="hr mb-3"></div>

        <p>This Privacy Policy describes how your personal information is collected, used, and shared when you visit or make a purchase from www.bookbae.store.</p>

            <h5><strong>Personal information we collect</strong></h5>
            <p>When you visit the Site, we automatically collect certain information about your device, including information about your web browser, IP address, time zone, and some of the cookies that are installed on your device. Additionally, as you browse the Site, we collect information about the individual web pages or products that you view, what websites or search terms referred you to the Site, and information about how you interact with the Site. We refer to this automatically-collected information as “Device Information”.</p>

            <h5><strong>We collect Device Information using the following technologies:</strong></h5>
            <p>
            &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;- “Cookies” are data files that are placed on your device or computer and often include an anonymous unique identifier.<br>

            <h5><strong>How do we use your personal information?</strong></h5>

            We use the Order Information that we collect generally to fulfill any orders placed through the Site (including processing your payment information, arranging for shipping, and providing you with invoices and/or order confirmations).

            <p>We use the Device Information that we collect to help us screen for potential risk and fraud (in particular, your IP address), and more generally to improve and optimize our Site (for example, by generating analytics about how our customers browse and interact with the Site, and to assess the success of our marketing and advertising campaigns).</p>

            <p>We share your Personal Information with third parties to help us use your Personal Information, as described above. We also use Google Analytics to help us understand how our customers use the Site.</p>

            <p>Finally, we may also share your Personal Information to comply with applicable laws and regulations, to respond to a subpoena, search warrant or other lawful request for information we receive, or to otherwise protect our rights.</p>

            <h5><strong>Behavioural advertising</strong></h5>
            <p>As described above, we use your Personal Information to provide you with targeted advertisements or marketing communications we believe may be of interest to you.</p>

        <h2><strong>Refund policy</strong></h2>
        <div class="hr mb-3"></div>
        <p>We have a 30-day return policy, which means you have 30 days after receiving your item to request a return.</p>

        <p>To be eligible for a return, your item must be in the same condition that you received it, unworn or unused, with tags, and in its original packaging. You’ll also need the receipt or proof of purchase.</p>

        <p>To start a return, you can contact us at contact@bookbae.store. If your return is accepted, we’ll send you a return shipping label, as well as instructions on how and where to send your package. Items sent back to us without first requesting a return will not be accepted.</p>

        <p>You can always contact us for any return question at contact@bookbae.store.</p>


        <h5><strong>Damages and issues</strong></h5>
        <p>Please inspect your order upon reception and contact us immediately if the item is defective, damaged or if you receive the wrong item, so that we can evaluate the issue and make it right.</p>


        <h5><strong>Exchanges</strong></h5>
        <p>The fastest way to ensure you get what you want is to return the item you have, and once the return is accepted, make a separate purchase for the new item.</p>


        <h5><strong>Refunds</strong></h5>
        <p>We will notify you once we’ve received and inspected your return, and let you know if the refund was approved or not. If approved, you’ll be automatically refunded on your original payment method. Please remember it can take some time for your bank or credit card company to process and post the refund too.</p>
