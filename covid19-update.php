        Dear Customers!<br><br>

        We just want you to know that we are taking every precaution in creating a safe atmosphere for our staff and customers!<br><br>

        The health and safety continues to be our top priority as we face the challenges associated with COVID-19. Prior to being shipped, each product, package, paper, sticker, etc. is sterilized to ensure safety for our customers. One of the many benefits of supporting small businesses is that we are able to inspect every single package that is shipped out to you!<br><br>

        Please notice that our carriers and shipping companies are experiencing delivery delays due to the sterilization process, but everyone is doing their best to deliver your package as soon as possible.<br><br>
        We will ALWAYS be here to answer your questions, track your order and make sure it is delivered safe and sound to your doorstep!<br><br>
        From our family to yours, stay safe and keep your heads up!<br><br>

        <strong>Please contact us anytime at:</strong> <a href="mailto:contact@bookbae.store">contact@bookbae.store</a>
